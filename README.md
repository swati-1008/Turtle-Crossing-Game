# Turtle-Crossing-Game

A classic game, built using Python, where the player (shown as a turtle) has to cross the entire screen while there are cars moving randomly from right to left.

Everytime the turtle reaches the finish line (top of the screen), it comes back to the start, and the level goes up by 1.

If meanwhile, it collides with any of the cars, the game ends.

Python's Turtle graphics has been used to build this project.
